I am a Computer Science major at the University of Oklahoma, set to graduate in Fall 2025. Throughout my time at OU, I have developed a passion for problem-solving and innovation, with a strong focus on database management, data analytics, and back-end development. My academic journey has been enriched by both coursework and hands-on projects, allowing me to enhance my technical skills and apply them in real-world scenarios. I’ve been actively involved in various research initiatives, including those focused on smart transportation and micromobility solutions, which have sharpened my analytical and technical capabilities.

Outside of academics, I am a member of the OU swim team, where I enjoy the camaraderie and challenge of competitive swimming. This experience has instilled in me the values of discipline, perseverance, and teamwork—qualities I bring to both my personal and professional endeavors. Whether it's in the pool or behind a computer screen, I am constantly pushing myself to improve and excel in everything I do.

My passion extends to areas such as video game development, where I enjoy exploring the intersection of creativity and technology. I am particularly interested in back-end development, ensuring smooth and efficient system performance. My work on projects like the Diet Companion web application has allowed me to apply and grow these skills, and I am excited to continue honing my expertise as I move forward in my career.
