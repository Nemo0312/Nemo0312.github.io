**Sequelize Model Generator** is a Python-based tool designed to automate the creation of Sequelize models for Node.js applications. The generator streamlines the process of defining database models, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than boilerplate code.

This project showcases my proficiency in backend development and software engineering principles, with a specific focus on code generation and database management. The tool accepts user inputs for model names and fields, translating them into a structured TypeScript format compatible with Sequelize.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/model-generator-interface.png" title="Model Generator Interface" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/generated-model-example.png" title="Generated Sequelize Model Example" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

The generator supports various data types, foreign key relationships, and primary key specifications, ensuring that the generated models are both flexible and robust. It utilizes user-friendly prompts to guide the model creation process, enhancing productivity and reducing potential errors.

As part of this project, I implemented features like input validation and the ability to edit the last input. This allows users to correct mistakes easily, making the tool more efficient and user-friendly. Additionally, the generated models automatically include timestamps for record-keeping, further enhancing their functionality.

By utilizing this Sequelize Model Generator, developers can expedite the setup of their database models, enabling faster project development and deployment. This tool contributes to a more streamlined workflow, particularly for teams working on large-scale applications.
